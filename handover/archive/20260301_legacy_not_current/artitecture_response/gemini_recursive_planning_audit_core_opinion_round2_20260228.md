I am reading the specified file to check for the required temperature and pricing penalty details.
PASS. The action plan explicitly states the hardcoded temperatures (`PLANNER=0.7`, `WORKER=0.0`) and the specific pricing penalties (`price += 1` for pass, `price -= 1` for fail, and `price -= 10` for KILLED).
