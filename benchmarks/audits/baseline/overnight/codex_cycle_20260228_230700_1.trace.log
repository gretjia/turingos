You are executing one baseline benchmark cycle. Do not edit any files.
Run exactly this command:
npm run -s bench:million-baseline-compare -- --modes turingos_dualbrain --start-test 83 --max-tests 102 --continue-after-fail

After command completion, stop. Do not edit files.
mcp startup: no servers

**Executing benchmark command**
codex
Executing the benchmark command exactly as provided in `/home/zephryj/projects/turingos`; I’ll wait for it to finish and then report completion status.
exec
/bin/bash -lc 'npm run -s bench:million-baseline-compare -- --modes turingos_dualbrain --start-test 83 --max-tests 102 --continue-after-fail' in /home/zephryj/projects/turingos

**Designing periodic polling loop**
codex
The benchmark is still running; I’m polling until the process exits.

thinking
**Adjusting polling interval**
codex
Still in progress with no output emitted yet; continuing to wait on the same process.
codex
The command is still running. I’ll keep polling until it exits.
codex
No output yet and the process remains active; waiting for completion.

Benchmark run is still active. Continuing to wait on the same session.

**Adjusting output frequency**
codex
Process has not exited yet and still produces no output; I’m keeping it running until completion.
codex
Still running. I’ll report immediately when the command returns.
codex
The benchmark command remains in progress with no output so far; continuing to wait.
codex
Still active. Polling again now.
codex
No change yet; waiting for the process to finish.
