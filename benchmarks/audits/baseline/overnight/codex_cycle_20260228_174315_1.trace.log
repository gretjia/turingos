You are executing one baseline benchmark cycle. Do not edit any files.
Run exactly this command:
npm run -s bench:million-baseline-compare -- --modes turingos_dualbrain --start-test 63 --max-tests 82 --continue-after-fail

After command completion, stop. Do not edit files.
mcp startup: no servers

**Starting exact command execution**
codex
Running the exact benchmark command in `/home/zephryj/projects/turingos` now, with no file edits. I’ll stop as soon as it finishes.

thinking
**Adjusting update polling timing**
codex
Benchmark is still running; no output has been emitted yet. I’m continuing to wait and will stop immediately once it completes.

**Setting 5-second polling interval**

thinking
**Scheduling final poll update**
codex
Still in progress with the same command and still no terminal output. I’m continuing to monitor until completion.

**Continuing polling process**

thinking
**Planning periodic commentary update**
codex
The benchmark process is still active with no emitted output so far. I’m keeping it running unchanged and waiting for completion.
codex
Command is still running without terminal output. Continuing to monitor until it exits, with no other actions.

thinking
**Continuing poll process**
codex
Still waiting on the same benchmark process; it has not printed output yet. I’ll stop immediately once it finishes.
codex
Process remains active and silent. Continuing to wait for completion with no file changes or extra commands.
codex
Benchmark command is still running and has not produced output yet. I’m continuing to monitor only this process.
